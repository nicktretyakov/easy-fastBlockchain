Installation
To get started with the Easy Fast Blockchain project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nicktretyakov/easy-fastBlockchain.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd easy-fastBlockchain


Install dependencies:

If the project uses Node.js:npm install


If the project uses Python:pip install -r requirements.txt


(Note: Adjust the command based on the actual programming language and dependencies used in the project.)




Usage
Once installed, you can interact with the blockchain using the following commands or API calls:

Start the blockchain node:

For Node.js projects:node start.js


For Python projects:python main.py


(Note: Replace with the actual command to start the node.)


Create a new transaction:

Use the provided API endpoint or command-line tool to add a new transaction to the blockchain.
Example (hypothetical):node cli.js add-transaction --from "sender" --to "receiver" --amount 100




Mine a new block:

Trigger the mining process to add a new block to the chain.
Example (hypothetical):node cli.js mine-block




Check the blockchain validity:

Verify the integrity of the blockchain to ensure no tampering has occurred.
Example (hypothetical):node cli.js validate-chain
